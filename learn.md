By creating a parent detector with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to set up and use a Raspberry Pi camera module
- How to take pictures with the camera with Python by following importing the correct libraries and following a sequence of instructions
- How to set up and use a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor for the first time using a while true loop in Python
- How to use variables to store information within your Python code to make it more efficent and easier to read
- How to add code to your Python program to detect movement, trigger the camera to record, and store the video file using functions
- How to play back any recorded videos from the command line
