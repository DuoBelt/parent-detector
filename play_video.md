## Playing video on the Raspberry Pi

If you look inside the file browser you should see any video files you have generated. You can play the videos in the terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+t`) by typing:

```
omxplayer <file> -o hdmi
```

For example: `omxplayer 2014-02-11_10.24.18.h264 -o hdmi`

Or you can rename the file to an `mp4` and open it in the Epiphany web browser.
